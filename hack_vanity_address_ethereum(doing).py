#     Here is the process taken by their script:

# 1. Get a public key for a vanity address.

# 2. Expand it deterministically to 1 in 2 million possibilities.

# 3. Decrement that key until it reaches the seed public key (the 32-bit vector)

# Now you have the seed for the private key associated with the public key for the vanity address.
